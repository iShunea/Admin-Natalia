# Runtime Environment Variables for Docker/Kubernetes
# These are injected into the HTML by the Express server
# DO NOT use VITE_APP_ prefix - these are runtime variables, not build-time

# SECURITY NOTE:
# Only expose values that the frontend needs to function
# NEVER expose server-side secrets like JWT_SECRET_KEY, database passwords, etc.

# ====================
# Required Configuration
# ====================

# Server Port
PORT=3000

# Application Version (displayed in UI)
VERSION=v9.2.1

# Router Base Path (MUST match VITE_APP_BASE_NAME in Dockerfile)
# This controls React Router paths: https://business.easyreserv.io/admin
BASE_NAME=/admin

# Backend API URL (REQUIRED)
# The frontend will send all API requests to this URL
# This should point to your actual backend service
API_URL=https://business.easyreserv.io/

# ====================
# Optional Features
# ====================

# Google Maps API Key (Only needed if using address autocomplete in forms)
# Restrict this key in Google Cloud Console to your domain for security
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyAXv4RQK39CskcIB8fvM1Q7XCofZcLxUXw

# Mapbox Access Token (Only needed if using map visualization pages)
# Restrict this token in Mapbox dashboard to your domain for security
MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoicmFrZXNoLW5ha3JhbmkiLCJhIjoiY2xsNjNkZm0yMGhvcDNlb3phdjF4dHlzeiJ9.ps6azYbr7M3rGk_QTguMEQ

# ====================
# Removed Configuration
# ====================
# The following have been removed because they're not used by your app:
# - JWT_TIMEOUT (backend handles this, frontend doesn't need it)
# - FIREBASE_* (you're using JWT auth, not Firebase)
# - AWS_* (you're using JWT auth, not AWS Cognito)
# - AUTH0_* (you're using JWT auth, not Auth0)
